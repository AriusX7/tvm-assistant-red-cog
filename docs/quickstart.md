Follow the steps below to quicky set up the bot for your game. You must have `administrator` permissions to use some of the commands. If you're a player looking to check the commands you can use, see [General](commands-reference#general) and [Misc](commands-reference#misc) sections.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning with the bot setup, make sure you've [invited the bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=680383600725590020&permissions=268494928&scope=bot) to your TvM server. Then check if the bot created a role named "TvM Assistant" with the following permissions:

- Manage Channels
- Manage Roles
- Manage Messages
- Read Messages
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Add Reactions

These permissions are necessary for the bot to work. If the role is missing, you can create a role manually or reinvite the bot (after kicking) using [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=680383600725590020&permissions=268494928&scope=bot). If any permission is missing, please add it manually.

Now that the bot is the server and has the necessary permissions, let's begin the setup.

**Note:** The stuff written inside `<>` and `[]` are called parameters. `<>` means required parameter, `[]` means optional. For example, if there is `<number>` written, simply enter a number, like `12`, without the `<>`. More on types of parameters [here](parameters).

## Step 1

Configure TvM settings. The following are configurable:

- [`-tvm changena`](commands-reference#-tvm-changena): Toggle if user can change their night action once submitted. Defaults to `True`.
- [`-tvm total <number>`](commands-reference#-tvm-total-number): Total number of players that can sign-up for the game. Defaults to `12`.

## Step 2

Use [`-tvm setroles`](commands-reference#-tvm-setroles) command. It will create `Host`, `Player`, `Replacement`, `Spectator` and `Dead` roles and assign you the `Host` role automatically. Feel free to change the name, color and other properties of these roles. [More about roles.](commands-reference#roles)

## Step 3

Use [`-tvm setchannels`](commands-reference#-tvm-setchannels) command. It will create **sign-ups** and **night action** (host-only) channels. Feel free to move the channels around or change their names. You can also change channel permissions but it may accidentally break some settings. [More about channels.](commands-reference#channels)

Users can sign-up as a player, spectator or replacement by using [`-in`](commands-reference#-in-ignored), [`-spec`](commands-reference#-spec-ignored) or [`repl`](commands-reference#-repl-ignored) commands in the **sign-ups** channel.

## Step 4

Use the [`-logchannel [channel]`](commands-reference#-logchannel-channel) command to set a channel as log channel. If you just use `-logchannel`, the bot will create a new channel called `log`. You can also set a channel you've already created as the log channel. Simply mention the channel in the command like this: `-logchannel #channel-name`. All message edits and deletes from **public** channels will be logged in the log channel. [More about logging.](commands-reference#logging)

**You can skip this step if you do not want message logging.**

We're done with basic configuration! You can now lock the TvM settings with the [`-tvm lock`](commands-reference#-tvm-lock) command so that you don't accidentally change settings. Now we have to wait till people sign-up. Follow the steps below once you've got enough players to start the game.

## Optional Step

The bot has a command to randomly assign a role to a player. See [`-rand <roles>`](commands-reference#-rand-roles) command for more info.

## Step 5

We'll now use the bot to create `Player`, `Mafia` and `Spectator` chats.

Firstly, use the [`-playerchats`](commands-reference#-playerchats-category_name) command. It will also create individual channels for mafia members. Please do not remove the channels of mafia members. Anyone can view the list of all server channels by using a custom Discord client.

Secondly, use [`-mafiachat <mafia1> [mafia2 [mafia3..]]`](commands-reference#-mafiachat-mafia1-mafia2-mafia3) command to create a mafia chat. Example of this command: `-mafiachat Arius#5544 Ligi @Siris#4421`

You can edit the name of player and mafia channels. You can move channels across categories but make sure you choose the **Keep Permissions** option. **Do not change channel permissions.**

Thirdly, use [`-specchat [channel]`](commands-reference#-specchat-channel) command to create a spectator chat. People with `Spectator` and `Dead` roles can see the spec chat. You can change specchat name, permissions, etc., without any unintended consequences.

Now that we have all channels ready, use `-tvm signclose` command to disable sign-ups. It is important that you do it because if you don't, signed up players may be able to use `-spec` command to get access to `Spectator` chat mid-game. While the bot has checks that ensure that players aren't able to do that after the game starts, sometimes the bot may not be able to detect that the game started.

By now, you would have set up all the user channels. Use the commands below only after you've given users their role, flavor, etc., and are ready to start the game.

## Step 6

Create cycle 1 channels. See [`-cycle [number]`](commands-reference#-cycle-number) and [`-night`](commands-reference#-night) for more information.

---

Congratulations, all the work is now complete! Just use `cycle` and `night` commands once every new cycle to keep the game running smoothly.
