However, the count may be broken in some cases. You can fix the count by specifying the cycle number when using the command. Simply using the `-cycle` command is recommended unless things are broken. Make sure to only use the command once per cycle.

Make sure you have the day opening text ready before using the command. Day and vote channels will be visible to users as soon as they are created.

*The bot asks for confirmation before making changes.*

### `-night`

Close the day and vote channels and open the night channel. Make sure you post the night starting text, minus the players ping, before using this command. Bot mentions the `Player` role once the channel is opened.

The bot may be unable to identify the correct day/night channels in some cases. In such cases, please open and close the channels yourself.

*The bot asks for confirmation before making changes.*

If you just use `-logchannel`, the bot will create a new channel called `log`. You can also set a channel you've already created as the log channel. Simply mention the channel in the command like this: `-logchannel #channel-name`.

### `-wchannel <channel>`

Whitelists `channel`. The messages in it will be logged irrespective of its permissions (as long as the bot can view this channel).

### `-bchannel <channel>`
